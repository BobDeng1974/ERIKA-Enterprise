                                 OpenZB TODOs 
********************************************************************************

GENERAL:
	- think some handle (function pointers?) to provide an easy way to 
	  change the protocol behaviours (i.e. for baccarat, etc.)

ozb_mac.c (Mac Core):
	- implement the sending CSMA and GTS queues
	- implement the frame building functions (data, cmd, ack)
	- manage the possibility to have auto ack?
	- put at this layer the phy callback on receive and parse the mpdus!

ozb_mac_mcps.c (MCPS):
	- implement send data function and the receive one.

ozb_mac_mlme.c (MLME):
	- complete a first subset of functionalities

ozb_mac_superframe.c (Beacon Enabled mode specific):
	- how to fully use the design with the ozb_radio for mac? 
	  (backoff period task for slotted csma, etc.)
	- send in GTS and CSMA slotted!

ozb_mac_gts_mechanism.c (GTS machine):
	- to think (DB of GTS, descriptor management, etc.)

TEST: 
	- need to test all the mechanisms

LOG: 
	- need to log some information for debugging but also for 
	  collecting experimental results (ozb logs).
