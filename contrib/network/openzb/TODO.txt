                       *_____   OpenZB TODOs   _____*              
********************************************************************************

GENERAL:
	- *3* Check the endianess, add macros for eandianess management when
	  reading/writing the stack frame!
	- *2* think some handle (function pointers?) to provide an easy way to 
	  change the protocol behaviours (i.e. for baccarat, etc.)

ozb_mac.c (Mac Core):
	- *7* put at this layer the phy callback on receive and parse the mpdus!
	- *3* implement the sending CSMA and GTS queues
	- *3* implement the frame building functions (data, cmd, ack)
	- *1* manage the possibility to have auto ack?

ozb_mac_mcps.c (MCPS):
	- *3* implement send data function and the receive one.

ozb_mac_mlme.c (MLME):
	- *1* complete a first subset of functionalities

ozb_mac_superframe.c (Beacon Enabled mode specific):
	- *8* Generalize the code: how do I choose I'm coord or device? 
	  (execution_time +  opzional compilation time)
	- *7* Implement the SF on the device side (parse beacon?)
	- *2* how to fully use the design with the ozb_radio for mac? 
	  (backoff period task for slotted csma, etc.)
	- *4* send in GTS and CSMA slotted!

ozb_mac_gts.c (GTS machine):
	- *7* Management of the GTS information device side (parsing beacon) 
	- *1* refine the gts_add_entry function to be compliant to the std 
	  (check the min cap size to be there!) 
	- *2* implement a gts_remove_entry functionality
	- *1* perform gts maintenance: allocations, deallocations

driver/radio/cc2420/inc/cc2420_hal_ee.h: 
	- *1* I suggest to remove any reference to DEMOBOARD, shall we?

TEST: 
	- *2* Check the include file dependencies and relationship to see if
	  only the "public" file are included.
	- *1* need to test all the mechanisms

LOG: 
	- *1* need to log some information for debugging but also for 
	  collecting experimental results (ozb logs).
