 <long_descr>
 Task demo: A minimal EE demo that demonstrates how to work with
 the MULTISTACK mode and conformance class ECC1.  In this demo two
 tasks are activated inside two ISRs and work with different stacks.
 There is also a separate stack for IRQs.  The compilation chain can
 start outside Eclipse environment from the Cygwin shell with the "make"
 command inside the Debug directory of the project.  The Debug directory
 can be created manually if you don't have the oil-based generator.
 The Debug directory must contain at least the following files (suitably
 modified...): eecfg.h, eecfg.c and the makefile (see the examples of
 different architectures to begin...)
